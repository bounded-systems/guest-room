# guest-room

**guest-room scopes what an agent is allowed to do, and refuses everything else
by construction — not by a reminder you hope it reads.**

I built it for my own work. I wanted an agent that did the task and didn't get
distracted or reach for things I never granted it. guest-room makes "exactly
these capabilities, nothing ambient" a real, testable object.

> New here? **[START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md)** is the two-minute version.

## Try it

```sh
bun run examples/quickstart.ts
```

It prints the rulebook a room hands an agent at launch — what it grants, and, by
name, what it denies:

```
[example-workcell — capability surface for THIS launch]
...

GRANTED:
- scout: external reads. Read external content through the scout door.

DENIED (the capability is physically absent from this box — do not attempt):
- keeper: No git-write authority here; relaunch with --keeper.
- net: No network here; relaunch with --net.
```

The denied lines are not advice. The capability is absent; there is nothing in
the box to reach for.

## Where this sits in tools you already use

- A **container** (Docker/Podman) bounds *where* a process runs and what it can
  *write*. It does not bound what it can *reach*: a mounted repo plus ambient
  network is still an exfiltration path.
- guest-room bounds what the agent can *reach*. Each capability is a **door**: a
  unix socket to a broker that holds the actual key and enforces a policy. The
  agent knocks; it never holds the key.
- If you've used a **policy engine** (OPA/Rego) or **seccomp**/Linux
  capabilities: this is a reference monitor for an agent's capabilities,
  enforced at a socket boundary. The decision lives outside the thing it governs.

## The model

- **door** — one capability: a `(name, socket)` grant. The key stays with the
  broker behind it.
- **room** — a named bundle of doors for a kind of work (`read` = scout only;
  `dev` = keeper + net + scout).
- **rulebook** — the per-launch manifest the agent receives: exactly what is
  granted, and what is denied.

The rulebook follows Searle's Chinese Room: the agent acts only through the cards
(doors) it holds, and a symbol with no card has no rule. A missing door cannot be
hallucinated into a success, because the rulebook names it as absent.

A door can be **attenuated** — narrowed by append-only caveats (a single host,
read-only mode). Authority only ever decreases: a holder hands a door onward
equally or more restricted, never wider. The caveat grammar is the consumer's;
the engine carries and renders it, never interprets it — the seam that keeps the
engine guest-agnostic.

guest-room is the runtime [`claude-box`](https://github.com/bounded-systems/claude-box)
turned out to be built on: nothing in here knows or cares who the guest is.
`claude-box` is one consumer — Claude Code — plugged into it.

## Transports — same authority, different wire

A door is a capability addressed over a **transport**, and the capability model is
transport-agnostic (`mod.ts`, *Door transport*): the **substrate** picks the wire,
the room never does. The same `keeper` door — same grant, same env var, same
in-room socket — is reached over:

- **unix** — a filesystem socket on the same machine (the default: container or native).
- **vsock** — a `(CID, port)` pair that crosses the VM boundary, for microVM
  substrates like [apple/container](https://github.com/apple/container), where a
  unix socket can't be shared host↔guest.
- **tcp** — a `host:port` across the network, for remote/distributed brokers.

`features/transport.feature` executes this: resolve a door over each wire and the
authority is the *same object* — only the broker address (`transportString`) moves.

**But the wires are not equally trustworthy, and that trust is a substrate
property, not an engine one.** A unix socket is gated by filesystem permissions and
lets the broker read the peer's kernel credentials (`SO_PEERCRED` on Linux,
`LOCAL_PEERCRED` / `getpeereid` on macOS/BSD) — the kernel vouches, unforgeably, for
*who* knocked. A vsock identifies the peer VM by CID. A tcp port carries no peer
identity at all: anyone who can route to it can knock. So moving a door to tcp
*loses* the authentication the kernel gave you for free, and the broker must
replace it on the wire (a per-launch token in the request envelope — `protocol.ts`
ships a fail-closed `tokenAuthorizer` for exactly this; an HMAC-per-request form
that also defeats replay is a drop-in at the same seam). The engine
carries the transport; the broker enforces the trust — the full reduction is in
[`docs/authority-and-attenuation.md`](docs/authority-and-attenuation.md).

## Where this maps — the security canon this *is*

guest-room doesn't invent a model; it's a mechanical instance of long-standing
ones. It is **not** OPA/Rego — Rego is a policy *language*; guest-room is the
reference monitor *around* a policy (the broker's caveat verifiers are the rules,
`checkCaveats` is the fail-closed combinator that calls them).

| Canon | What it says | Where guest-room is it |
|---|---|---|
| **Saltzer & Schroeder** (1975) | least privilege · fail-safe defaults · complete mediation · economy of mechanism | the rulebook (least authority) · `deniedDoors` (deny by default) · `checkCaveats` (fail-closed mediation) · small pure TCB |
| **Reference monitor** (Anderson 1972) | tamper-proof · always-invoked · small enough to verify | the broker at the socket boundary + `checkCaveats`; the engine is pure functions on purpose |
| **Object-capability model** (Miller) | authority is an unforgeable reference, not an actor property; narrow by attenuation | the whole `door` model; `attenuate` is Miller's rule |
| **Macaroons** (Google 2014) | append-only caveats narrow a credential | `attenuate` / `attenuatesDoors` are macaroon-shaped |
| **NIST Zero Trust** (SP 800-207) | no ambient trust · per-request authorization · PDP/PEP split | nothing is ambient · per-request `checkCaveats` · broker = PEP, verifiers = PDP |
| **NIST SP 800-53** | AC-3 access enforcement · AC-6 least privilege | door resolution + the rulebook |
| **OWASP Top 10 A01:2021** | Broken Access Control — enforce deny-by-default, server-side | the door boundary is that server-side control |
| **OWASP LLM Top 10 — LLM06:2025** | Excessive Agency — bound an agent's functionality/permissions; *don't let the model decide its own authorization* | the core thesis: authority is absent unless granted, decided outside the agent |

The sharpest match is **LLM06 (Excessive Agency)**: OWASP's own mitigation —
*"do not rely on the LLM to decide whether an action is authorized; all downstream
systems must independently enforce authorization"* — is verbatim what the door
boundary does. Peer credentials are where that enforcement bottoms out: the
kernel, not the payload, decides who is on the other end of a unix-socket door.

## Usage

The engine is parameterized over a **catalog** (the doors a kind of room can
furnish) and **room bundles** — both supplied by the consumer. `mod.ts` carries
no product identity: no image, no account model, no container runtime. Those are
the guest, and they stay in the consumer.

```ts
import {
  expandRoom, deniedDoors,
  capabilityPreamble, grantedDoorLines, deniedDoorSection,
  type DoorCatalog, type RoomCatalog,
} from "@bounded-systems/guest-room";

// The consumer owns the catalog (which doors a kind of room can furnish)...
const catalog: DoorCatalog = {
  keeper: {
    flag: "--keeper", inBox: "/run/keeperd.sock", env: "KEEPERD_SOCK",
    hostDefault: "/tmp/keeperd.sock", grants: "signed git writes",
    use: "Route every git write through the keeper door.",
    deny: "No git-write authority here; relaunch with --keeper.",
  },
  // ...net, scout, etc.
};
const rooms: RoomCatalog = { dev: { doors: ["keeper"], about: "edit & commit" } };

// ...guest-room resolves the grants and renders the honest rulebook for a launch.
const granted = expandRoom(rooms, catalog, "dev", process.env);
const denied = deniedDoors(catalog, new Set(granted.map((d) => d.name)));
const rulebook = [
  ...capabilityPreamble("my-workcell"),
  ...grantedDoorLines(granted),
  ...deniedDoorSection(denied),
].join("\n");
```

## Every claim here runs

The specs in `features/*.feature` are executed against the engine (`mod.ts`) by
`bun test`. Describe a behavior the engine lacks and the suite goes red, so the
docs cannot drift from the code.

| Claim | Proven by | Pinned at |
|---|---|---|
| A room grants exactly its doors and denies the rest, by name | `features/rulebook.feature` → `deniedDoors` / `deniedDoorSection` in `mod.ts` | `5a44110` |
| Attenuation is append-only — authority never widens | `features/attenuation.feature` → `attenuate` / `attenuatesDoors` | `5a44110` |
| A capability dies with its lease and never exceeds its ceiling | `features/confinement.feature` → `isConfined` / `resolveProvider` | `5a44110` |
| The engine names no guest, so it works for any agent | `guest-room.test.ts` ("names no guest") | `5a44110` |
| A door's authority is the same object across unix/vsock/tcp wires | `features/transport.feature` → `unix`/`vsock`/`tcp` / `transportString` / `resolveDoor` in `mod.ts` | `877a11b` |
| The algebra holds for EVERY case, not just examples (attenuation ≡ superset; enforcement is fail-closed and monotone; confinement is ceiling-bound + lease-gated) | `algebra-proofs.test.ts` (bounded model checking by exhaustion) | `412b3f2` |

```sh
bun test
```

The fixture catalog in the test is a deliberately non-Claude hotel — proof the
engine works for any guest.

## Going deeper

- [`docs/the-guest-room.md`](docs/the-guest-room.md) — the long-form essay: why a
  room, not a box. (The hotel metaphor lives here, where it has something to
  ground itself in.)
- [`docs/authority-and-attenuation.md`](docs/authority-and-attenuation.md) — what
  guest-room proves about authority, what it defers to the substrate, and where a
  provenance layer fits above it.
- [`docs/scorecard.md`](docs/scorecard.md) — an honest self-rating against the
  canon above (per spec: proven in-engine vs. deferred vs. the real gap), the
  algebra theorems now proven by exhaustion (`algebra-proofs.test.ts`), and the
  verification roadmap (what to reach for next, in TS or Rust).

In the object-capability tradition (POLA), with macaroon-style append-only caveat
attenuation and lease-bound confinement.
