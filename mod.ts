// guest-room — a guest-agnostic room+door capability runtime.
//
// This module knows nothing about any particular guest: no guest identity, no
// image, no container runtime. A ROOM is walls plus a furnished set of DOORS; a
// DOOR is a single (name, socket) capability brokered by a daemon that holds the
// authority the room never does. A door may be ATTENUATED — narrowed by opaque
// caveats the broker enforces — and attenuation is append-only, so a door can
// only ever be handed onward equally or more restricted, never wider. The room
// hands its guest a RULEBOOK keyed to exactly the doors present — a card per
// granted door (how to use it, and any restriction on it) and a card per denied
// door (there is no rule; do not attempt).
//
// A consumer supplies the door CATALOG and the room bundles; guest-room resolves
// grants, derives the honest granted/denied surface, and renders the rulebook
// lines. The consumer keeps its own launch mechanics (which runtime, which
// image, how state mounts) — those are the guest, not the room.
//
// Extraction note: this directory is a self-contained internal dependency. When
// it graduates to its own repo, it moves as-is and consumers flip the import
// path; nothing here names a guest — a test enforces that the engine source is
// guest-agnostic, so the seam can't silently re-couple.
